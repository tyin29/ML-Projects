In particular, you will use the continuous-bag-of-words approach, which trains a model to predict a word based on the embeddings of surrounding words. For example, in the sentence \"the man walks the dog in the park\", the embeddings for the words (\"man, \"walks\", \"dog\", \"in\") will be used to predict the word \"the\" (if your context size is 2 on each side of the target word)."
